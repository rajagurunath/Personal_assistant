# Personal_assistant

I build this simple personal mail assistant one year ago as my first python project ,sorry for the improper code structure !but trust me it works!

This project was build on top of other Open source libraries example :easygui, arivx, docx,outlook application etc
About:
Every function was built with help of python with security, in mind  your mail data will not be sent to outside world and completely in your local system

This assistant is capable of following things

1. Prepares Timesheet ,i.e collects Meeting-timing for past  2 or 3 months and store it in a excel
Analyse your meeting Timings ,where you are spending more time ,i.e Which projects you are sending more time etc
example:meeting_timesheet


2.Analyse your mailing pattern , i.e read your inbox and sentbox mails and plots a graph and attach those things in a document 


3.It classifies your mail into 10 buckets (customizable , as of now 10 projects name ) and put some charts.
10 buckets are Microservice ,RPA,birthday,coffee events,Devops,others etc



4. You can also query this assistant by specifying someone's name or date ,it will provide all related mails/events specific to that person or date
Example :gurunath or 01/29/2018


5. You can Analyse popularity of particular term or keyword based on number of google searches
Example you can compare ,two keywords such as 
1.Medicine vs Engineering
2.cardinality vs prodapt etc

6. you can download latest journals from arixv sanity website by providing keyword, it will   collect  abstract from those papers and gives you a document 
for example :use keyword such as

7. IT can summarize a article for you by giving a url to this assistant and puts those summarized points in a document
Example (https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513696/deep-learning/) attached with this mail.

8. IT helps in purchasing items  from Amazon,
by giving particular product name it will scrape the amazon website and suggest a excel of products with rating given by the customers
 Example:laptop 

9. if anything goes wrong you can provide feedback with a feedback button it will send the error messages to me, from your outlook id
